# Volatility-Forecasting

Market volatility forecasts are essential for portfolio management, risk control, derivatives pricing, and regulatory decisions. Traditional models like the Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model use past volatility over different time horizons (daily, weekly, monthly) to predict future volatility, assuming stable market dynamics with fixed parameters.

However, financial markets often move through distinct regimes, such as calm, crisis, and recovery phases, that cause volatility behavior to change over time. In these settings, the statistical relationship between past and future volatility is not constant, and fixed-parameter models may fail to capture such evolving patterns, reducing forecast accuracy.

Our research addresses these challenges by developing regime-aware forecasting frameworks that detect structural breaks and adapt to changing market conditions. By combining historical realized volatility with forward-looking indicators like the Implied Volatility Index (VIX), our models adjust dynamically to different volatility regimes, improving predictive performance.

Ultimately, this work enhances the robustness and reliability of volatility forecasts, supporting better-informed real-time decisions in risk management and hedging.
